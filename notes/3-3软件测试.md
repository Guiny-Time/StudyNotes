# 3-3软件测试
## Verification与Validation
- 对产品、服务或系统是否符合规定、要求、规范或强加条件的评估。这通常是一个**内部过程**
- 对产品、服务或系统满足客户和其他确定的涉众需求的保证。它通常涉及接受和适应**外部客户**
> Verification: “The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with validation.”
Validation: “The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers. Contrast with verification.”
